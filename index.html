  <pre id="Abstract_InText" class="ex1" style="font-size: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The study of galaxy formation throughout history has played a huge role in understanding our own galaxy, but the structure of the universe itself, with some of the earliest galaxies being formed around "300-400 million years ago after the Big Bang" <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/articles/galaxies-were-already-dying-just-700-million-years-after-the-big-bang?">(Williams, 2025).</a>
This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of hydrodynamical simulations in studying galaxy formation, which are well known and reliable computational methods used in this particular area of astrophysics <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04024">(Joop Schaye, 2023).</a>
To investigate the premise, the model FLAMINGO, a model developed by researchers at the University of Leiden, was chosen, where it was evaluated based on its accuracy in calculating stellar masses, how effective it was in reproducing galaxy clusters and how big its reliable data range was.
During its runtime, the model was observed to be exceptional at resolving stellar masses and had an accuracy of 10-20% for galaxies with a mass bigger than 10¹⁰ solar masses<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08277"> (Joey Braspenning, 2024).</a> However, the model appeared to struggle at resolving galaxies with stellar masses lower than 10⁹ solar masses, including small and dwarf galaxies, suggesting that the model’s accuracy was mainly limited by the galaxies size when compared to other models.
Thus, FLAMINGO was determined to have the lowest rate of uncertainty for galaxies that were larger than 10⁹ solar masses <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17217">(Roi Kugel, J 2015).</a>

  <h3 id="Introduction" class="mainheadings">Introduction</h3>
  <pre id="Introduction_InText" class="ex1" style="font-size: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;">
  Hydrodynamical simulations are incredibly powerful tools that have allowed scientists to research how galaxies form. It is a type of simulation that uses mathematical equations of gravity and gas dynamics to show how galaxies form and evolve over time <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept13/Silk/">(Galaxy Formation - Joseph Silk et al., 2013).</a>
  They are often reported to have an uncertainty of about 0.1 to 0.2 dex for the most part when working out stellar masses, with some reports even claiming a low uncertainty of 0.01 dex for ideal scenarios<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/418/3/1587/1060932">(Edward N. Taylor, 2011).</a> and a range of 0.3-0.5 dex for galaxies with intricate star formation histories<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/435/1/87/1106259">(Peter D. Mitchell, 2013).</a>
  Researchers from the university of Leiden have developed a hydrodynamical simulation known as FLAMINGO, a model that is highly considered suitable for this task thanks to its use of of sub-grid prescriptions,simplified laws of physics, This allows it to study important properties such as stellar masses that are crucial for making predictions on how galaxies form. 
  By taking into account the potential of hydrodynamical simulations, this paper asseses how hydrodynamical simulations can be used to model galaxy formation followed by an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of FLAMINGO and considerations for possible improvements in its quality. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04552">(Van Daalen et al (2025)).</a>

  <h3 id="Methodology" class="mainheadings">Methodology</h3>
  <pre id="Methodology_InText" class="ex1" style="font-size:18px; white-space:pre-wrap;">
    To evaluate the use of hydrodynamical simulations for studying galaxy formation,the model was tasked to resolve the stellar masses of galaxies using the galaxy stellar mass function, 
    a statistical method that measures the number of galaxies ranging from different stellar masses located in each volume of space by dividing the number of galaxies over the simulation volume. A calibration was performed against the observed SMF at redshift z = 0
    to ensure that the simulation was able to produce a realistic galaxy population based on the stellar mass distribution. This was done by using a subgrid model that is calibrated against real-world observations that other models are based on, which was plotted on a graph
    showing the relationship between the baryonic particles, the building blocks for modeling galaxies and responsible for forming the stellar mass that the SMF consists off, with the box side length, which determines how many galaxies can be modelled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04024">(Joop Schaye, 2023).</a>

  <h3 id="Analysis and discussion" class="mainheadings">Analysis and discussion</h3>
  <pre id="Analysis_InText" class="ex1" style="font-size: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;">
    FLAMINGO has shown a sufficient degree of agreement with other observations for galaxy clusters produced by other computational models as shown in figure 1. The model was adequately calibrated to match the low-redshift mass function within a resolved range while also managing to study baryonic suppression, reducing the clumps of normal mater within the universe. However, the model faced limitations, particularly when using baryon particle masses of 10^8–10^9 M⊙, suggesting that predictions could not be as reliable when analysing low-mass galaxies such as dwarf galaxies <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.17819v1#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20diverse%20range%20of,the%20intricacy%20of%20studying%20overdensities.">(Joey Braspenning, (2024)).</a> Moreover, these figures suggest that the model was faced with a limited resolution, which could imply less accuracy when investigating star-forming regions.

  <h3 id="Conclusion" class="mainheadings">Conclusion</h3>
  <pre id="Conclusion_InText" class="ex1" style="font-size: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;">
    This paper evaluated the use of computational models in the investigation of galaxy formation. Throughout the examined model, FLAMINGO, the most important factors such as baryonic masses and resolution were considered, which were then evaluated in the output given the model. The results showed that although the computational model was relatively accurate when modelling galaxy clusters within a high stellar mass range, it struggled to provide a precise plot when dealing with a data range that it was not accustomed to, this being stellar masses lower than 10^8–10^9 M⊙  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04024">(Joop Schaye, 2023).</a> Nevertheless, the data showed that it could be a reliable model for investigating galaxy formation when tuned with the right parameters despite its limitations compared to other computational models. 
    To improve the quality of the outputs for computational models in galaxy formation, a higher resolution and richer calibrations would resolve dwarf galaxies and galaxy interiors, which would then increase the data range that the model could be reliably used in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17217">(Roi Kugel, J 2015).</a> This initiative would be ideal and highly considered by astrophysicists.
