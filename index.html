    <pre id="Abstract">
The study of galaxy formation is undeniably essential; it plays a crucial role in understanding the structure of the universe. The aim of this paper is to explore galaxy formation by evaluating the efficiency of computational models, specifically hydrodynamical simulations, 
which are a kind of computer model that employ a wide range of mathematical equations to model fluid dynamics and explore how these particles interact with each other in the context of galaxies such as the ones responsible for producing dark matter and baryonic matter. 
To investigate this proposition, an investigation was carried out by selecting one of the datasets produced by FLAMINGO, a hydrodynamical simulation that was produced by physicists at the university of Leiden that models the large-scale structure of the universe. 
In all the simulation runs, the model was found to be quite exceptional at calculating stellar masses, with an accuracy ranging approximately between 10-20% for galaxies with a mass bigger than 10¹⁰ solar masses in stars. 
In addition, it was effective in reproducing to cluster gas fractions to about 10% accuracy. However, the model appeared to struggle at resolving galaxies with stellar masses lower than 10⁹ solar masses, including small and dwarf galaxies, suggesting that the model’s accuracy was mainly limited by the galaxies size.

“Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an
intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of
learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample
candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential
to improve the classification model.”
